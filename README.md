# Zomatopy-food-delivery-application
*My first application*:  
Deployed a back end application with model,view,template (MVT) using python and MySQL with a login module for user registration of the food, placing the  order, canceling the particular order, and checking the status of delivering. Also, implemented MySQL queries for tables, functions delimiters  deployed with the help of Wamp Server.
